# final_project_customer_segmentation
conduct customer segmentation to determine prices based on hotel location

# Introduction to Project
This is the final project of the mentored Business Intelligence bootcamp. In this project I did customer segmentation or clustering using a dataset from Airbnb London download the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/london-uk-airbnb-open-data/code

# Introduction to Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a market or consumer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. The objective of customer segmentation is to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and preferences of each group, enabling businesses to design marketing strategies, products, and services that are more tailored to the specific requirements and interests of their target audience.

# Some Methods of Customer Segmentation
1. Demographic segmentation is based on characteristics such as age, gender, income, education, and marital status.
2. Geographic segmentation is based on geographic location, such as country, region, city, or neighborhood.
3. Psychographic segmentation is based on the customer's lifestyle, values, attitudes, and personality.
4. Behavioral segmentation is based on consumer behavior patterns, such as product usage tendencies and loyalty levels.

# Clustering method in this project
In this project, we implemented a clustering method that combines demographic and geographic segmentation. The clustering process is implemented using the KMeans algorithm from the Scikit-Learn library.

# Key Performance Index (KPI)
## Problem Statement
1. Analyse reviews per host and district for service improvement.
2. Identify hosts and districts with high revenue potential.
3. Identify the most popular districts.
4. Monitor the popularity of room types according to guest preferences.

## Output
1. Max & Billie are the hosts with the most reviews
2. Westminster is the most popular district with 306 facilities among the top 10 hosts 
3. Westminster has the highest expected revenue among other districts
4. Airbnb accommodation is mostly available in the city centre

# Market segmentation based on 2 variables (price, and geographical location)
## Problem Statements
1. Which segments are most effective in converting prospects into customers?
2. What is the occupancy rate achieved and its relationship to the price offered?

## Output
1. The most optimal market segmentation generated by the DBSCAN algorithm is 6 clusters.
2. Cluster 4 is the cluster with the highest prices and is located in the city centre.
3. Cluster 0 is the cluster with the lowest prices, and the City of London is one of the districts in this cluster.

# Marketing channel analysis
## Problem Statements
1. Measuring Marketing Strategy Effectiveness
2. Evaluate Operational Performance and Profitability

## Output
1. Cluster 1 has the highest conversion rate & occupancy rate, although in order of price cluster 1 is a low-cost accommodation group.
2. Cluster 0 has the lowest conversion rate & occupancy rate, this is in accordance with the position based on price where cluster 0 is the lowest cost accommodation among other clusters.

# Summary
1. Clusters with elevated accommodation prices, including Luxury Locals and Elite Estates, demonstrate elevated conversion rates while exhibiting lower occupancy rates. This reflects exclusivity, which may constrain their market reach.
2. More affordable clusters, such as Budget Boroughs, have the highest occupancy rates, indicating that lower-priced accommodation is more desirable to tenants. However, conversion rates are also low, suggesting that there is a discrepancy between demand and supply. This indicates a robust demand for affordable housing options.
3. Clusters such as Comfort Corners and Economy Enclaves demonstrate an optimal balance between conversion and occupancy rates, indicating their ability to attract tenants without compromising their appeal.
4. Market segmentation based on location and price:
   Cluster 4 (Elite Estates) and Cluster 0 (Luxury Locals) appeal to the upper segment with luxury properties in optimal locations. Cluster 1 (Budget Boroughs) and Cluster 5 (Economy Enclaves) are well-positioned to serve the lower middle segment at more affordable prices.
   There is a high demand for affordable areas, as demonstrated by Cluster 2 (Comfort Corners) and Cluster 3 (Mid-Range Metros). These areas have high occupancy rates and are suitable for young professionals and families who require access to the city center and competitive prices.
5. Space Constraints and Focus on Convenience:
   Both Clusters 0 and 4 have a more targeted market segmentation. Cluster 0 likely reflects an established residential area, while Cluster 4 is focused on the upper class. Despite their high demand, these locations present unique opportunities for further market segmentation.
